objective: 'I love writing code and often do so in my free time. My colleagues describe me as a good technology generalist and often say I am quick to pick up new technologies. I see software as a way to shape the world and I am looking for a company whose mission I can get behind. I have experience working in big software teams, alone and everything in between. I am currently living in Eindhoven, Netherlands but willing to relocate for the right opportunity',
